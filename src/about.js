            <h1>The Problem</h1>
            <p>
                There are millions of types of candy bars around the world, but how do you choose which one to eat? Each person has different preferences, allergies, and dietary needs, so there is no 'one size fits all' candy bar. The various different types of candies out there often have different types of packaging, and it can be difficult for people to read nutrition labels correctly when they are choosing which candy bar to buy. The current problem with candy choices is that people only often know about the larger brands of candy, like Kit-Kat, Snickers, etc. so they are not exposed to other types of candy that might suit their preferences better. Furthermore, many people do not know how to correctly read a nutrition label, so finding the sugar content, or finding out if a type of candy violates dietary restrictions can be difficult. As of now, there are no web app solutions to helping people choose a type of candy to eat, and instead, people rely on the advertising, packaging, and labeling of the candy bar itself to find out what it contains and whether or not they can eat it. According to
                <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sugar/defenseless-addicted-sugar-marketing#2">this</a>
                article, false advertisement can cause many negative affects such as an addiction to sugar. Our web app is focused on helping people make informed decisions about their candy bars. Using our web app will help them choose a few that match their taste preferences and dietary needs through different categories of classification, like sugar content, chocolatey, fruity, and many more.
